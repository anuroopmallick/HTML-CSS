cascading in css The style that comes later is applied


Specificity in css - Based on this hierarchy style is applied 
1. id 
2. class 
3. element  -->

<!-- More specific the score then they will be prioritised  -->

<!-- !impoprtant 
1. follows cascading rule regardless of specificity value 
2. use only once in a selector 
3. if it is used twice then specificity rule will be followed  -->

<!-- Inheritance  -->
<!-- 1. allows styles to be inherited from parent  -->
<!-- 2. Margin, padding, border ,width cannot be inherited  -->
<!-- 3. For inherited properties in css check the link -> https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css/inheritance  -->

2. relative - positioned based on its own position, example: shifts the book in the bookshelf
3. absolute - positioned based on its closest positioned ancestor or parent container , example : removes book from book shelf -->
