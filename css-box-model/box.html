<!-- Important things that I did not know about css before are the following 


Inline vs block vs inline-block :
1. block level elements take the whole row space 
2. inline elements take only the required space 
3. Inline-Block takes the required space but we can also provide height and width to the element 

Margin collapse : 
When placing two boxes in column and the upper box has margin-botton = 30px and the bottom has margin top 20px 
The total margin between the top and bottom box will be the max of margin provided in this case 30px. 
This however does not happen when placed side by side. In that case it takes the sum of margin. 

Css Positioning: 
1. Static - Elements are positioned in the normal document flow.
   CSS Property: position: static; (default, no need to specify explicitly).
   Use Case: When you don't need to adjust an element's position.
2. relative - Positioned relative to its normal position.
   CSS Property: position: relative;
   Behavior: The element remains in the document flow but can be shifted using top, right, bottom, or left.
   Use Case: Fine-tuning or using as a reference point for absolutely positioned child elements.
3. absolute - Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (relative, absolute, or fixed). 
   If no ancestor is positioned, it is relative to the viewport.
   Behavior: Removed from the document flow; other elements ignore its space.
   Use Case: Precise placement of elements.
4. fixed - Positioned relative to the viewport (does not move when scrolling).
   Behavior: Removed from the document flow.
   Use Case: Sticky headers, footers, or sidebars that remain visible.
5. sticky- A hybrid of relative and fixed. It behaves like relative until a scroll threshold is reached, then it becomes fixed.
   CSS Property: position: sticky;
   Behavior: Sticks within its parent container.
   Use Case: Sticky headers or navigation bars
6. z-index  -->
